    /// * `output_sample_rate` - The sampling rate to resample to.
    /// * `input_sample_rate` - The sample rate `data` was initially sampled at.
    /// * `loop_start` - The start point of looping.
    /// * `loop_end` - The end point of looping. If this value is 0 then it is
    ///   assumed there is no looping.
    ///
    /// If `loop_end` is less than `loop_start`, they shall be swapped. If
    /// `loop_end` is 0 and `loop_end` is >0 then they are swapped and those
    /// loop points are used, rather than disabling looping.

    /// if you want to loop at the end of the data container then `data.len()`
    /// should be passed for the `loop_end` parameter, and if you'd like to loop
    /// a single sample, `sam` and `sam+1` should be used for the loop points.
